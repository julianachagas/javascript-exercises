## Mini-projects and exercises: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

A collection of mini-projects and exercises I did to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<br>

- **Bitcoin price tracker**: app that shows the current Bitcoin price in the selected currency. API: [Blockchain.com Exchange Rates API](https://www.blockchain.com/api/exchange_rates_api)

  - Concepts practiced: Async JS, API, DOM manipulation
  - [Live project](https://codepen.io/julianachagas/full/ExEmWaO)

<br>

- **Busca CEP**: search for a Brazilian address based on the postal code (CEP) entered (language: portuguese). API: [Via CEP](https://viacep.com.br/)
  - Concepts practiced: Async JS, API, DOM manipulation, Regex
  - [Live project](https://codepen.io/julianachagas/full/oNqWZbK)

<br>

- **Chuck Norris Jokes**: app that displays random Chuck Norris jokes. API: [chucknorris.io](https://api.chucknorris.io/)
  - Concepts practiced: Async JS, API, DOM manipulation
  - [Live project](https://codepen.io/julianachagas/full/rNdmyxZ)

<br>

- **Country Data**: this app gets information about the country entered by the user. It displays a card with the country's name, region, subregion, capital, flag, population, languages, and currencies. It uses the [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/).
  - Concepts practiced: Async JS, API, DOM manipulation
  - [Live project](https://codepen.io/julianachagas/full/yLKoNKw)

<br>

- **Guess My Number**: the goal of this project is to guess a secret number that is between 1 and 20. The user can type a number in the input field, click the 'check' button, and they'll get a feedback message that says if the guess was too low, too high, or correct. The user starts with a score of 10 and after each failed guess, the score decreases by 1. The user can start a new round by clicking on the 'again' button. This project is part of the Complete JavaScript Course - From Zero to Expert by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).
  - Concepts practiced: DOM Manipulation, Event Listeners
  - [Live project](https://codepen.io/julianachagas/full/ZEoaWxE)

<br>

- **Where am I**: this app displays the location (city and country) based on the GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) provided by the user. It also displays a card with information about the country. Two APIs are used in this project: the [BigDataCloudâ€™s Reverse Geocoding API](https://www.bigdatacloud.com/docs/api/reverse-geocode-to-city-api) is used to get the location based on the provided coordinates (reverse geoding) and the [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) is used to get the data about the country previously received from the other API. This project is a coding challenge from The Complete JavaScript Course - From Zero to Expert by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).
