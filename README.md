A collection of mini-projects and exercises I did to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **Bitcoin price tracker**: app that shows the current Bitcoin price in the selected currency

  - Concepts practiced: Async JS, API, DOM manipulation
  - [Live project](https://codepen.io/julianachagas/full/ExEmWaO)

- **Busca CEP**: search for a Brazilian address based on the postal code (CEP) entered (language: portuguese)
  - Concepts practiced: Async JS, API, DOM manipulation, Regex
  - [Live project](https://codepen.io/julianachagas/full/oNqWZbK)
- **Chuck Norris Jokes**: app that displays random Chuck Norris jokes
  - Concepts practiced: Async JS, API, DOM manipulation
  - [Live project](https://codepen.io/julianachagas/full/rNdmyxZ)
- **Where am I**: This is a coding challenge from The Complete JavaScript Course - From Zero to Expert by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). This app displays a card with information about a country based on the GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) provided by the user. Two APIs are used in this project: one to get the location (city and country) based on the provided coordinates (reverse geoding) and another to get the data about the country previously received from the other API.
  - Concepts practiced: Async JS, API, DOM manipulation, `array.filter()`, `Object.values`
